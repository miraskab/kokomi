          <div id="description">
              <p class="text"><b>Sangonomiya Kokomi</b> - The Divine Priestess and Supreme Leader of Watatsumi Island. Just like how she is versatile in handling military strategies and domestic affairs on her island, she is equally as busy in regards to her in-game capabilities: A healer, AoE Hydro applier, buffer, and on-field or off-field damage dealer. Enabling both vast role diversity and role compression, this affords her a spot in many teams.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="text">Truthfully, she can also be considered a victim of many misunderstandings and misinformation. Due to her unique scaling and diverse capabilities, surface level analysis and opinions have plagued her characterisation since her release, and her strengths have only appreciated in worth and understanding as time has gone by.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="text">This guide aims to explain Kokomi's complexities and allow players to better utilize the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.</p>

          <h1>Pros & Cons</h1>
          <div class="text table" id="pros-cons">
              <div id="pros">Pros</div>
              <div class="pros-item">Wide skill set â€” both in role variety and role compression.</div>
              <div class="pros-item">In particular, the paladin archetype (healing and dealing damage) is a rare and sought after playstyle for many players to get the job done with comfort.</div>
              <div class="pros-item">Consistent Hydro application in a wide AoE is another key and sought after role.</div>
              <div class="pros-item">Elemental Skill being cast right in front of the player model is quite synergistic with other character abilities and allows very controlled setup sequences.</div>
              <div class="pros-item">Has synergy with an incredible number of teammates. Accounts are almost guaranteed to have multiple teams available.</div>
              <div class="pros-item">Incredibly fast animations allow for fast setups and more efficiency.</div>
              <div class="pros-item">Many weapons at her disposal, including several F2P options.</div>
              <div class="pros-item">Artifact farming can be streamlined due to not needing CRIT; fewer stats to seek out.</div>
              <div id="cons">Cons</div>
              <div class="cons-item">Teams generally utilise a few of her roles. Investments in certain areas can be useful or useless depending on the team. This includes talents, weapons, artifacts and constellations.</div>
              <div class="cons-item">Despite artifact farming being streamlined, CRIT stats have no value, meaning a reduced amount of useful rolls. This can also limit her damage ceiling.</div>
