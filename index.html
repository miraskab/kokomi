            <p>Truthfully, she can also be considered a victim of many misunderstandings and misinformation. Due to her unique scaling and diverse capabilities, surface level analysis and opinions have plagued her characterisation since her release, and her strengths have only appreciated in worth and understanding as time has gone by.</p>
            <p><b>Sangonomiya Kokomi</b> - The Divine Priestess and Supreme Leader of Watatsumi Island. Just like how she is versatile in handling military strategies and domestic affairs on her island, she is equally as busy in regards to her in-game capabilities: A healer, AoE Hydro applier, buffer, and on-field or off-field damage dealer. Enabling both vast role diversity and role compression, this affords her a spot in many teams.</p>
            <p>This guide aims to explain Kokomi's complexities and allow players to better utilize the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.</p>

                    <div>

                      <p>Gathering the might of Hydro, Kokomi plunges towards the ground from mid-air, damaging all opponents in her path. Deals <b>AoE <b class="text-colored-main">Hydro DMG</b></b> upon impact with the ground.</p>

                <p>A 3-hit Normal Attack combo and AoE Charged Attack. Normal Attacks are <b>projectiles</b> with very small AoE. Her Charged Attack has a larger AoE and uses a separate Internal Cooldown for Hydro application. Therefore it can be useful for shield breaking or maintaining Hydro auras.</p>
                <p>However, the usefulness of these attacks is a separate discussion to the value of its Talent scaling.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that Kokomi's <b>basic attacks have two sets of scaling</b>. This talent scales off ATK and is largely an insignificant portion of her on-field damage output, which her Elemental Burst talent has more relevance towards. For example, at Talent Level 9 it can account for around 9% of her total damage in a Mono Hydro team. Past a bare minimum, investment in this talent is of the lowest priority.  </p>
                <p>With Constellation 1, the 3rd hit of her Normal Attack string will supply an additional attack with a fixed scaling based on her Max HP, although the extra hit is not considered a Normal Attack. Due to its fixed scaling nature, having this Constellation can further diminish the benefits of leveling this talent. (see <a href="#talents-priority">Talent Level Priority section</a> for more)</p>
                <p>As with all Catalyst users, ATK SPD buffs like the 10% buff via her Constellation 4 act as direct multipliers to Normal Attack spam, provided she does not get interrupted.</p>

                      <p>Summons a "Bake-Kurage" created from water that can heal her allies. Using this skill will apply the <b>Wet</b> status to Sangonomiya Kokomi.</p>

                    <div>
                      <p><b>Bake-Kurage</b></p>
                      <p>Deals <b class="text-colored-main">Hydro DMG</b> to surrounding opponents and heal nearby active characters at fixed intervals. This healing is based on Kokomi's Max HP.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>A continuous 12s source of healing and AoE Hydro application, it is the constant pillar of her kit and used in every team to great effect. It has three significant value propositions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Area of Effect</li>
                  <li>Sustained</li>
                  <li>Off-field</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bake-Kurage has no ICD on its Elemental application and will therefore be applying Hydro onto enemies every 2 seconds. Only one Bake-Kurage can exist on the field at a time. Including the initial hit, it will attack for a total of 7 times over the course of 12s. Each following pulse has a 67% chance to generate one Hydro elemental particle (requires hitting enemies), meaning on average 4 Hydro particles are generated over its base duration (the final tick cannot generate a particle).</p>
                <p>Casting her Elemental Burst in conjunction with her A1 Talent Passive will refresh the Skill's duration. Despite it normally being locked into a stationary position for 20s (refreshing via Burst does not allow repositioning), using a weapon like Sacrificial Fragments can allow readjustments. This tech is most significantly used in Nilou Bloom teams, which lack grouping sources yet rely on Bake-Kurage heavily. </p>
                <p>On cast, it will also apply the Wet status onto Kokomi. This can cleanse Elemental debuffs, although it can also be a disadvantage by making her vulnerable to Freeze.</p>
                <p><b>Additional Tech Info:</b> This Skill also snapshots buffs on cast. Consequently, while it does not normally snapshot the HP scaling from her Burst, it is possible to snapshot it by recasting her Skill as Burst mode is ending, and quickly swapping off before the first tick of the new Skill. Using a simple application of this, it is possible to maintain 100% uptime on bonuses just by timing your rotations. Still, this Tech can be difficult and is generally not worth using in practice.</p>

                      <p>Summons the might of Watatsumi, dealing <b class="text-colored-main">Hydro DMG</b> to surrounding opponents, before robing Kokomi in a Ceremonial Garment made from the flowing waters of Sangonomiya.</p>
                    </div>

                        <li>Sangonomiya Kokomi's Normal Attack, Charged Attack and Bake-Kurage DMG are increased based on her <b>Max HP.</b></li>
                        <li>When her Normal and Charged Attacks hit opponents, Kokomi will restore HP for all nearby party members, and the amount restored is based on her <b>Max HP</b>.</li>
                        <li>Increases Sangonomiya Kokomi's <b>resistance to interruption</b> and allows her to walk on the <b>water</b>'s surface.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>These effects will be cleared once Sangonomiya Kokomi leaves the field.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Requiring 70 Energy, casting this will activate Kokomi's Ceremonial Garment, adding considerable <b>HP scaling</b> to each of her abilities for a 10s duration. She will lose this state upon switching out. Although unused in popular off-field focused roles (such as Freeze), her Burst is a crucial component in all her other teams. Alongside the refreshed and buffed Bake-Kurage, players will typically spam Normal Attacks, which now heal the entire party with each successful hit. Therefore, during this period, in addition to dealing increased damage with increased resistance to interruption, <b>the party is effectively immortal.</b></p>
                <p>She will also have increased resistance to interruption during this period, although it is not Infinite Poise/Hyper Armor. Therefore, reinforcements such as Xingqius Rain Swords will result in noticeable improvements in tanking heavy hits.</p>
                <p>Moreover, her A4 Talent further increases the HP scaling of her Basic Attacks by 15% of her Healing Bonus while under the effects of her Elemental Burst. This actually makes her damage output scale the best with stacking HP and Healing Bonus, due to how significant the damage gained from these is. Therefore, these also make the aforementioned ATK scaling of her base Basic Attacks have low relevance (See the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> for further explanations). For example, at Talent Level 9 the Burst mode's enhanced Basic Attacks and Bake-Kurage can account for around 58% of her total damage in a Mono Hydro team (See <a href="#talents-priority">Talent Leveling Priority</a> for more info). This makes <b>resource investment in her Elemental Burst Talent the most valuable</b> by far for her on-field playstyles.</p>
                <p>All of her Constellations enhance her output whilst in her Burst state, although her Constellation 1 uses a separate, fixed scaling (30% of Max HP).</p>
                <p>She is also able to walk/run on any water’s surface during this state, which has niche applications in overworld traversal.</p>

                <p>Due to Bake-Kurage normally having an 8s downtime, this Passive allows her to maintain 100% uptime on her Elemental Skill. Higher uptime means increased particle generation, Hydro application, healing and buff uptime (if using Tenacity of the Millelith).</p>
                <p>In fact, some niche teams may just alternate between casting her Skill and Burst every 10s and immediately switch her out in order to maintain this constant Bake-Kurage. However, this is very rarely optimal, and in her most common Freeze teams, Kokomi actually hardly even uses her Burst or this Passive in favour of just using her Skill roughly every 20s.</p>
                <p><b>Important Note: Refreshing Bake-Kurage requires it to be on the field when the Burst animation ends, so please cast your Elemental Burst at least a second before the Skill expires</b>. This can be annoying as it necessitates either keeping mental timing or doing precise rotations, otherwise the window for refreshing may be missed, wasting her Burst too.</p>

                      <div>
                        <p>Sangonomiya Kokomi has a 25% <b>Healing Bonus</b>, but a 100% decrease in <b>CRIT Rate</b>.</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                <p>Certainly the most obfuscated part of her kit in terms of implications. Simply put, this combines with the rest of her kit to trade CRIT scaling for Healing Bonus scaling. That's all it really has to mean for all intents and purposes. However, nuanced implications can be assessed:</p>
                <p>The downside of this tradeoff is that CRIT stats are effectively useless. Less important for weapon choice, since that can be easily navigated, yet this still has a huge impact on her Artifacts. Typically, players yearn for many CRIT substat rolls on their pieces; however, on Kokomi, they are dead rolls. Combined with Healing Bonus only being available as a main stat via Circlet, and unavailable through substats, these elements <b>limit her growth via artifact investment</b>. It's also well known that typically CRIT substats provide the highest damage increases in most characters' situations, so this further accentuates the loss in growth potential.</p>
                <p>The upside is that ultimately this tradeoff has borderline <b>no significance to limiting her actual roles</b  >. Just because CRIT multipliers are lost does not mean she cannot be the highest damage dealer in significant teams. It’s more akin to a <b>twist or gimmick</b> to her builds more than anything. It’s smarter to consider it nothing more than a twist too.</p>
                <p>Another obvious upside is that this Passive also enables her to lean more heavily into the paladin archetype. Her damage dealing builds (or any of her builds) will never shut her off from the healing role, and (aside from Bloom teams valuing EM) target investment goals are streamlined into hunting basically just HP, ER, and Healing Bonus stats to boost her entire kit.</p>

            <div id="combo-description-child" class="pressable-child" style="display: none;">
              <p>In her Burst mode “<b>Ceremonial Garment</b>”, Kokomi is relatively easy to pilot and you can largely do almost anything as long as you keep using Normal Attacks. Complicating Combos rarely benefits a team's performance dramatically, and actually poor execution can be a net negative. Such consequences include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>running out of Stamina</li>
                <li>poor positioning</li>
                <li>losing procs from off-field damage dealers</li>
              </ul>

              <p>It is recommended to play on-field Kokomi in whatever manner feels comfortable for your account and your device while keeping in mind some basic reminders:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dashing and regular repositioning has very practical use in combat. It’s helpful to not rely too much on her range, especially since her Normal Attacks make her move slightly backwards. There is also the range of her Skill and other team abilities to consider. Moreover, while Kokomi can tank enemy attacks with her healing, these movements can also aid with dodging heavy attacks that would otherwise stagger her.</li>
                <li>Her Charged Attacks are very Stamina-intensive, and consecutive use can limit Stamina reserve for dashing.</li>
                <li>Still, as mentioned earlier, Charged Attacks are an effective tool in applying more Hydro for both shield breaking and team reactions. They also spawn directly below the target, providing vertical range against enemies on hilichurl towers and allowing her to hit annoying targets behind fences/obstacles.</li>
                <li>The HP and Healing Bonus scaling from Nereid's Ascension and Song of Pearls flatten the differences in the damage scaling on her Normal and Charged Attack hits. Furthermore, a lot of her output can come from the Ocean-Hued Clam set effect, which generally hits its DMG cap every 3.5s. The higher Talent multipliers of her 3rd Normal Attack hit and Charged Attack are therefore less important than they initially look.</li>
                <li>Her Constellation 1 highly incentivizes finishing her combo with the third Normal Attack. This results in more damage AND more Hydro application.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><b>Using N3 or N3D is most recommended.</b></p>
              <p>N3 - This is easy and just uses her full Normal Attack string, whilst saving any complications for practical adjustments like prior mentioned dash repositioning or dodging. This also allows her to remain in her Normal Attack animations longer, potentially allowing her to trigger more Sword Rain and Exquisite Throws from Xingqiu and Yelan. Full Burst mode target: 5N3</p>
              <p>N3D - The N3 animation can be dash canceled for minimal improvement right after the projectile forms, but take care to learn the timing as dashing before it forms results in no damage being dealt at all. For an example comparison, whilst full left-click spam could get 5N3, efficient dash canceling can net an extra N2 before her Burst mode state expires.
                Full Burst mode target: 5N3D N2 (6 N3D is theoretically possible)
              </p>
              <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YvXp8d4za4" loading="lazy"></iframe>
              <p><b>N2W (Not recommended), N2D (Partially recommended)</b></p>
              <p>How to perform N2W: Trigger two Normal Attacks, tap the walk button with careful timing, trigger two Normal Attacks again, repeat.
                Example Burst mode target: 9N2W
              </p>
              <p>N2 combos take advantage of her small damage differences between her hits, so getting more overall hits in can result in higher output. For example, squeezing 9N2W’s can result in a 9-10% DPS increase for Kokomi in Mono Hydro over N3 spamming, and in Electro-Charged teams it may trigger more Beidou Burst/Fischl C6 procs.</p>
              <p>However, that doesn’t make it recommended. N2W is impractical to consistently perform for most people, and even lacks repositioning without N2D. The resulting <b>poor execution can result in net losses</b>. Further losses can occur when playing alongside off-field damage dealers like Yelan. Losing out on their hits will be a dramatic loss (Yelan's Exquisite Throws trigger whilst in Normal Attack animations, and Kokomi's N3 naturally has more time in the animation).</p>
              <p>Even in the above-mentioned Mono Hydro example as a best case scenario, with the team giving her high personal damage output (⅓~ of the team's output depending on investments), she is still only one of several damage dealers, and other comps like Electro-Charged can have her dealing a lower damage share than that. 
                Therefore, the practical damage gain is always <b>questionable in terms of team DPS</b> for how much focus you need to execute them in otherwise relatively easy teams. Still, if stamina is available, <b>throwing in a few N2D's to speed up a fight is helpful</b> and can be recommended. Just don't attempt to spam it too much.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if Constellation 1 is acquired, utilising the extra fish attack for increased damage from full N3 combos is advised regardless.</p>

              <p>Crown Elemental Burst if interested</p>
              <p>As explained many times by now, Kokomi on field has several sources of damage, which skews perceptions of Talents. </p>
              <p>It should be understood that, due to its ATK scaling, her Normal Attack Talent (The Shape of Water) is very low priority and even in the end game can be reasonably left at Level 6.</p>
              <p>Kokomi's Burst, Nereid's Ascension is her most significant talent, and out of all options the most worthwhile to take to Talent Level 10 or close thereto.</p>
              <p>Her Skill, Kurage's Oath, has relevance for all playstyles. However, in popular off-field focused teams of hers such as Freeze, her healing is generally more than satisfactory at any reasonable investment level; therefore, it's never really necessary to prioritise it to the point of being leveled the highest.</p>
              <p>Still, be cautious of outside scaling damage sources and how significant they are. Kokomi never really makes the most from Talent level ups.</p>
              <p>For example, with Level 9 Talents and Prototype Amber, in the Mono Hydro team with Yelan, Kazuha (no Burst), and Xingqiu, Kokomi's damage distribution against 1 enemy can be calculated to be as follows:</p>

                    <p>While donning the Ceremonial Garment created by <b>Nereid's Ascension</b>, Sangonomiya Kokomi's Normal Attack SPD is increased by 10%, and Normal Attacks that hit opponents will restore 0.8 Energy for her.</p>

                <p>Provided Kokomi is being used in an on-field role, we’re actually looking at a significant amount of Energy restoration, which is neatly synergistic with the ATK SPD increase alongside it. As mentioned, since Kokomi is a Catalyst user and not subject to hitlag, this ATK SPD buff is a direct and efficient multiplier to her kit. Although do note that she still deals a lot of damage via Ocean-Hued Clam, which is independent of this.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p><b>Note</b>: It is highly recommended to treat the following section as a general guideline. Ultimately, we recommend using the <a href="https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/" target="_blank">Genshin Optimizer</a> to finalize your builds. In particular, it allows you to choose team buffs and can more accurately judge the correct balance between offensive stats for artifacts specific to your account. In case you need one, here’s a great tutorial for how to use Genshin Optimizer: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcVsEMZO5IVFQdeh8zteZwiNchObfQ684" target="_blank">Genshin Optimizer Tutorial Playlist</a>.</p>
            <p>Due to her diverse role, both Kokomi’s ideal artifact sets and target stats are never set in stone. Rather, it is something to assess after deciding on a team composition and required strategy for her in that role. Consider skipping to the Teams section and reevaluating choices after.</p>
            <p>Sets that are not mentioned are not relevant enough and not recommended for consideration.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text table" id="artifacts">
            <div class="table-name artifacts-name interactive" id="artifacts-name0" name="first"><img src="images/artifacts/ohc.webp"></div>

              <div class="item-body">
                <p>OHC increases Kokomi’s Healing Bonus and provides a strong additional source of AoE Physical damage through her healing prowess. It does want Kokomi in her Burst mode to hit its damage cap, typically 24.3k damage 3 times during the state. Outside of the Burst state, hits often deal about ~30% of that depending on investment, but this is still highly appreciated.</p>
                <p>This is her general go-to set in most circumstances, and highly recommended to farm for on-field playstyles especially. Probably the most versatile set too, considering it can function adequately in off-field roles, providing her HP and Healing Bonus stats are built well. </p>
                <p><b>Note</b>: OHC is also great in Bloom teams.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item artifacts-item" id="artifacts-item0">
              <div class="item-body">
                <p>With her long lasting Elemental Skill, ToTM sees effective use in some of Kokomi’s off-field teams where, with its 4pc set bonus, she can give ATK buffs to significant damage dealing teammates. A perfect example would be when supporting Ayaka in a Freeze team. Kokomi’s output with OHC is replaced by increasing her buffing capabilities with 4pc ToTM. The 2pc set bonus will also give her 20% HP for reinforced healing.</p>
                <p>With her Burst refreshing her Skill to circumvent Bake-Kurage downtime, she can have practically permanent uptime on the ATK buffs. However, permanent uptime is not necessary due to many teams having either burst damage windows that fit within the buff uptime or teammates with snapshottable abilities.</p>
                <p>For players struggling to farm OHC for on-field roles, strong ToTM sets can also suffice as poverty alternatives.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item artifacts-item" id="artifacts-item0">
              <div class="item-body">
                <p>GD sees surging use as a Kokomi set due to her partnership with Nilou in Bloom teams, although OHC can still be preferred. These teams can be somewhat random in regards to exactly which character is triggering Bountiful Core explosions; however, one constant is Kokomi being a frequent trigger of these explosions. Therefore, EM is an extremely valuable stat for her, and Gilded Dreams supplies it in mass quantities. </p>
                <p><b>Note</b>: In Triple Hydro teams, Gilded Dreams gives less EM than 2pc 2pc EM sets (Gilded Dreams/Wanderer’s Troupe/Flowers of Paradise Lost)</p>
                <p>Nilou Bloom teams as a whole like lots of EM stats. Additionally, the domain to farm this also supplies Deepwood Memories, a must-have set in Bloom teams. Therefore, with this composition, farming GD is very efficient.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item artifacts-item" id="artifacts-item0">
              <div class="item-body">
                <p>For use in Bloom teams. FoPL can provide an even bigger increase to Kokomi’s Bloom reaction damage than GD.</p>
                <p>The reaction damage bonuses it provides is additive with Elemental Mastery, meaning the value of this set will be stronger the more EM Kokomi already has. This also works vice versa, and at minimal EM investment it may not even be an improvement over Gilded Dreams. When using this set, it is therefore recommended to stack as much EM as possible.</p>
                <p>However, a key drawback of FoPL is that even with well invested builds, the damage increases over GD can be minimal. With Bloom teams also requiring Deepwood Memories sets, farming for GD can be more efficient for overall results. Also remember, OHC is a valid artifact set even in Bloom teams too.</p>

              <p>With the sets covered, we can turn to the stats to hunt for. As highlighted below, these also vary depending on the team.</p>
              <p><b>On-Field Kokomi (General)</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>HP%/ER% Timepiece, Hydro DMG% Goblet, Healing Bonus% Circlet. Maximises damage whilst also strengthening healing performance.</li>
                <li>For substats, prioritise ER > HP% > HP >= ATK%. Being able to consistently Burst is crucial in these teams, so make sure Kokomi’s ER statline is sufficient for her team. Fortunately, most weapon options contribute towards her Energy needs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>On-Field/Off-Field Kokomi (Nilou Bloom)</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>In Double Dendro teams: EM Timepiece, EM or Hydro Goblet, EM or Healing Bonus Circlet all work. The incoming recoil damage from Bountiful Cores may tempt more HP stats for healing reinforcement, but remember Kokomi’s reaction damage is significant in these teams. Still, EM mainstats are not mandatory. Hydro DMG and Healing Bonus can be used for increased non-reaction damage and survivability.</li>
                <li>For substats, prioritise as much ER, HP% and EM as possible. Some of these main stat pieces are rare, so take what is on offer.</li>
                <li>In Triple Hydro teams: HP% Timepiece, HP% Goblet, Healing Bonus% Circlet. Focusing on survival is fine. Kokomi can still trigger some reactions, so look for EM substats.</li>
              </ul>
              <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbdwoyZjRjs" loading="lazy"></iframe>
              <p><b>Off-Field Kokomi (General)</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>HP% Timepiece, HP% Goblet, Healing Bonus% Circlet. Maximises healing for comfort since her damage is often of secondary importance.</li>
                <li>For substats, prioritise HP% and HP. ER substats can be beneficial by giving more regular windows to refresh her Elemental Skill via Burst as needed. Though 100% uptime is often unnecessary, having options available doesn’t hurt, especially when healing performance can be easily sufficient enough.</li>
              </ul>

                      <p>Due to Nilou’s unique Talent <b>Court of Dancing Petals</b>, which enhances standard Dendro Cores into Bountiful Cores, she is effectively purely designed around Bloom teams. She is also limited to just Hydro and Dendro teammates in order to activate this and other talents within her kit. Together, the goal is to generate as much AoE Dendro and Hydro application as possible, maximising Bloom detonations. Kokomi is very effective in achieving this alongside providing additional tools with her role compression.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Bountiful Cores deal significant recoil damage. Kokomi’s healing from various sources provides vital role compression. This is critical, as there aren't many defensive units within the Dendro Element yet.</li>
                        <li>As a Catalyst wielder with on demand Elemental Basic Attacks, Kokomi can flexibly spend time in and out of Burst mode to bring additional Hydro application. As a bonus, Burst mode attacks will also ramp up recovery from recoil damage.</li>
                        <li>Nilou’s teammate limitations prevent Anemo supports, which are usually instrumental in AoE content due to their grouping. Kokomi wielding Sacrificial Fragments circumnavigates this somewhat. Its passive allows regular repositioning of Bake-Kurage, such adjustments aiding with the optimal coverage of its range for dynamic encounters. As a bonus, it also provides EM for Kokomi’s reaction damage.</li>
                        <li>The only real anti-synergy with Nilou is that Kokomi is usually incentivised to stack HP and Healing Bonus. However, since Kokomi typically deals important damage in the team by triggering a notable portion of Blooms, EM is key of raising the team’s ceiling. Focusing on EM can reduce her Max HP and overall healing potential, however hybrid builds covering all stats can also be strong and well-rounded.</li>
                        <li>Even if fully investing in EM (this includes artifact set bonuses), Kokomi’s base healing performance is strong enough that with careful play, surviving will be fine.</li>

                        <li>Yelan’s A4 Talent will also provide a significant DMG bonus to Kokomi on-field, which she can utilise whilst repeatedly triggering Yelan’s Exquisite Throws for mutual benefit (though it won’t increase OHC’s damage).</li>
                        <li>As they both create Hydro particles, they can reduce each other's ER requirements notably. The specific highlight of this is that with Yelan, it’s a lot easier to hit breakpoints to where she no longer has to run Energy-oriented weapons. Due to her own off-field DMG strength, trading something like Favonius Warbow for Aqua Simulacra is a huge benefit.</li>
                        <li>Yelan’s Elemental Skill can minorly group up enemies, setting them up closer for Kokomi and other common teammate’s deployable Skills.</li>
                        <li>For higher budget players, Yelan’s C4 provides rare HP% buffs which is not only beneficial to Kokomi and herself, but also common teammates they can pair with like Nilou.</li>

                        <li>Kazuha is the premier Elemental DMG buffer, and combined with RES Shred via 4pc VV, he can boost Kokomi’s damage tremendously. This is exceedingly useful with common teammates like Yelan who do not benefit from common ATK buff sources, or teammates who do not snapshot ATK buffs like Xingqiu or Yae Miko and therefore can often lack buffed damage.</li>
                        <li>Elemental DMG bonus itself is also more universal than perhaps how Sucrose primarily buffs EM. Teammates, whether focusing on reaction damage or not, will benefit from Elemental DMG bonus, so it is commonly more efficient.</li>
                        <li>His crowd control is tied to his Elemental Skill, but unlike other options this Skill is very versatile with short cooldowns. This actually makes him the most consistent grouper due to his Skill’s regular uptime throughout fights.</li>
                        <li>His grouping also pulls enemies towards him, and its circular nature has natural synergy with Kokomi and common teammates, such as being able to pull enemies towards an AoE Freeze zone, or towards Kokomi’s and Fischl’s deployable Elemental Skills, in a controlled manner.</li>
                        <li>His plunge can Shatter Frozen targets, potentially undoing careful grouping when using low Hydro application. However, with Bake-Kurage’s long and sustained Hydro application this is a non-issue.</li>

                        <li>Sucrose has similar buffing utility to Kazuha (4pc VV, Elemental DMG Bonus from her C6), but specialises more in sharing huge amounts of EM to her teams. This can be very effective in raising the floor of the team’s collective reaction damage. It allows teammates without EM investment to still do appreciable reaction damage, particularly in Electro-Charged teams which typically have chaotic reaction ownership.</li>
                        <li>As a Catalyst user, Sucrose is effective in triggering frequent reactions on field. She also has a separate Elemental application ICD on her Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, Skill, and Burst, further bolstering this utility.</li>
                        <li>Although Kokomi is very capable of spending time driving in her Burst mode, pairing her with Sucrose offers more flexibility. Sucrose is available to share the on-field driving role (if not focusing on Sucrose driving entirely) whilst triggering additional reactions and constantly refreshing 4pc VV debuffs.</li>
                        <li>Sacrificial Fragments can also be used on Sucrose for additional grouping and Energy. This grouping flexibility can be very important for keeping enemies within Kokomi and other teammates’ AoE range.</li>
                        <li>Kokomi and Sucrose also synergise with each other well in terms of gear. One can focus on damage whilst the other covers utility, or they can both give additional buffs to teammates. These decisions are very flexible and generally will not dramatically shift total output, although one should pay attention to practical differences. For example, Sucrose using Sacrificial Fragments offers more grouping, and TTDS can make for less rotational freedom.</li>

                        <li>All of Kokomi’s attacks, particularly her Elemental Skill and Basic Attacks, can all reach inside Venti’s Burst. Outside of Freeze, the Energy refund he provides helps a great deal as well, especially in Electro-Charged teams where Kokomi may be the only Hydro character.</li>
                        <li>Unfortunately, he doesn’t really supply additional DMG buffs like Kazuha or Sucrose, and his effectiveness is limited outside of AoE content, meaning he isn’t ideally suited to many battles Kokomi’s teams may be readying for.</li>
                        <li>Take caution: Kokomi’s Bake-Kurage gets placed next to her, and Venti’s Burst is aimed a few meters in front of him. This can require careful repositioning.</li>

                        <li>Kokomi provides long lasting, AoE, off-field Hydro application. Her Bake-Kurage’s range may not literally cover the entire map, but it is as close to an <b>ideal Hydro applicator</b> as Ayaka could ask for.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, Kokomi allows faster setups than other Hydro options due to only needing brief field time to cast her Elemental Skill.</li>
                        <li>She can buff Ayaka via TTDS and Tenacity of the Millelith. Building for this is incredibly accessible and has a low investment cost.</li>
                        <li>Just like Kokomi, many common teammates’ talent casts are also centered around the character model. Teams can have great control and fluidity over the Freeze AoE zone, with a character like Kazuha pulling enemies towards Bake-Kurage to maintain consistency.</li>

                        <li>Ganyu’s Elemental Burst is powerful and long-lasting (AoE Icicles lasting 15s), and yet it can still snapshot buffs. Kokomi with TTDS and ToTM will give significant ATK buffs to her. Ganyu’s Charged Attacks also benefit more from ATK buffs, due to their increased CRIT Rate.</li>
                        <li>Kokomi’s brief field time and fast setups also allows for easier rotations and <b>more Charged Attacks fired</b>.</li>
                        <li>Ganyu’s damage lacks a Burst window and is more focused on constant, sustained damage output. Therefore, compared to Ayaka, she stands to gain a lot more from Kokomi refreshing Bake-Kurage with her own Burst cast; otherwise a lot of hits can lose Blizzard Strayer bonuses. The issue is that integrating the refresh is tedious and can require significant ER stat investment from Kokomi, potentially compromising with Energy-focused weapons on teammates too.</li>
                        <li>Ganyu can also feel a bit inharmonious with Kokomi, due to her Skill dashing away from enemies, and Kokomi casting her own Skill next to the player model. In comparison, Mona and Venti cast talents slightly ahead of the player model, synergising better with Ganyu’s Skill and overall ranged playstyle.</li>

                        <li>Unlike other units who provide personal offensive value or defensive utility while also providing Energy, Shenhe, while still offering good amounts of Energy, provides more buffs to damage dealers and rockets frontloaded performance.</li>
                        <li>Due to Shenhe scaling with Cryo DMG dealers, a character like Kokomi consolidating roles of Hydro application, buffs, and healing is greatly appreciated, and teambuilding/gearing considerations that may compromise damage are not needed.</li>
                        <li>Kokomi providing ATK buffs via Tenacity of the Millelith will also constantly increase Shenhe’s Icy Quill performance.</li>
                        <li>A niche synergy is that Shenhe’s Burst reduces enemies' Physical RES, which increases the damage from Kokomi’s OHC set (though OHC is typically not used in Freeze).</li>

                        <li>Rosaria is commonly played alongside a Cryo damage dealer like Ayaka. Due to Kokomi’s healing role, Rosaria is able to freely play her role alongside a final offensive utility teammate like Kazuha. If not for Kokomi, many players would feel more comfortable with defensive utility from Diona, restricting Rosaria’s use.</li>
                        <li>Rosaria’s Elemental Skill’s ability to pursue targets and improve positioning is very underrated and brings unquantifiable value. Similar to Shenhe, this later allows Kokomi to be comfortably placed to Freeze surrounding enemies.</li>
                        <li>A niche synergy is that with C6, Rosaria’s Burst reduces enemies' Physical RES, which increases the damage from Kokomi’s OHC set (though OHC is typically not used in Freeze).</li>
                        <li>Rosaria does have short cooldowns on activating her Skill and Burst, which can clash with Kokomi’s longer cooldowns by neutering Rosaria's efficiency.

                        <li>Strong in Hyperbloom teams. Whilst usually leading her own teams in an on-field role, Kokomi can effectively utilise Raiden as an off-field AoE Electro source to trigger Hyperblooms. In this role, Raiden uses a full <b>EM build</b> and just casts her Elemental Skill, with her Burst unneeded</li>
                        <li>Raiden's Skill can trigger as fast as 0.9s per hit, but it is important to consider how the Hyperbloom reactions are still capped at 2 Cores at a time, as well as it depending on how constant Kokomi and a Dendro teammate can create the Cores. These faster hits compared to Shinobu’s may not actually mean much in practice.</li>
                        <li>The Skill will also hit at the enemy's position, which will be conveniently close to spawning Dendro Cores. Unlike Shinobu, this also means Kokomi can utilise a bit of her range if needed.</li>
                        <li>Overall, their biggest synergy may be to Raiden's benefit. For example, in a Hyperbloom team core of Raiden and Nahida, neither have healing or shielding. This can create a dilemma for the remaining teammates, especially as one has to be a Hydro character. Kokomi meets all conditions, and can even take on an off-field only position. Thus, she can allow an array of options for their last teammate.</li>

                        <li>Strong in Hyperbloom teams. Despite normally having a slow Electro application rate due to ICD on her Elemental Skill (Grass Ring of Sanctification), each Dendro Core she hits is considered a fresh entity. As long as Kokomi and her Dendro teammate(s) are creating the Cores, this allows Shinobu to constantly trigger Hyperblooms every 1.5s in an AoE around the player model. The duration of Shinobu's Elemental Skill is 12s at C0 and 15s at C2, which makes her a very practical teammate for Kokomi.</li>
                        <li>Whilst Shinobu usually further synergises with Hyperbloom teams due to both her healing utility and natural EM scaling via A4 Talent, this is obviously less relevant for Kokomi.</li>
                        <li>In terms of their damage, Shinobu's Skill does tick slower than Raiden's Skill (meaning theoretically slower Hyperbloom reactions), but it can be a very insignificant difference in practice. Importantly, Shinobu can be considered more accessible as a 4* character.</li>
                        <li>If available, Shinobu can also boost the team even more with the Key of Khaj-Nisut. Not only can this boost her own EM further than 4* weapons can, but the EM share it provides can also be very useful for common Kokomi teammates like Nahida or Kazuha.</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>A staple of Dendro teams, Nahida can apply <b>on-demand, sustained and strong Dendro application</b> within a massive range. She can do this entirely off-field, or supply even more Dendro application with on-field Basic Attacks. Her level of consistency is unmatched across Dendro characters, and as such she is very much appreciated in both Bloom and Hyperbloom compositions.</li>
                        <li>Her reaction potential is further boosted by her Elemental Skill (the core of her kit) having direct EM scaling. In addition, her A4 Talent further enhances her Skill's DMG and CRIT Rate. These together allow her to <b>benefit heavily from EM investment</b>, and coupled with CRIT stats she can deal both strong reaction and non-reaction damage.</li>
                        <li>Nahida's Elemental Skill duration being both long lasting and frequent is very helpful to Kokomi. Firstly, unless the marked enemies are defeated, there's no need to worry about it running out whilst Kokomi enters her Burst mode. Secondly, the frequency and strength of this off-field Dendro application is ample enough for consistent reactions, whether it's just Bake-Kurage solo or in tandem with Kokomi's on-field attacks. Overall, there are rarely issues with the sufficiency of Nahida's Dendro application.</li>
                        <li>Another key synergy is role compression. As Dendro reaction-focused teams can involve 3 Elements reacting together, Kokomi's ability to take a Hydro teammate slot whilst covering the healing role is very helpful for Nahida. The fact that Kokomi can also do this all off-field allows full offensive choice for their teammates without having to compromise the team's survival.</li>
                        <li>Nahida's Elemental Burst is also able to provide Kokomi with a huge EM Buff whenever Kokomi is on-field. The value of this can vary depending on how many reactions Kokomi is triggering in any given team. It will also increase Nahida’s own damage when Kokomi is switched out or even solely used in an off-field role.</li>
                        <li>The main annoyance to Nahida is having to recast her Elemental Skill each wave of spawning enemies. This can interrupt Kokomi during her Burst mode.</li>

Although real caution is needed over the recoil damage she can sustain during this on-field period, particularly with her fragile max HP, Kokomi’s sustained healing (even when prioritising EM stats) can mitigate much of this concern.</li>
                        <li>Her Skill can be recast every 12s, which has synchrony with Kokomi’s Bake-Kurage duration and common teammate Skills like Fischl’s Oz. Despite her Boomerang + Sprout not lasting with 100% uptime, this is still very helpful in Hyperbloom teams as the reaction feeds off of continuous application from all 3 Elements</li>
                        <li>Collei provides 60 EM to teammates at C4, as well as an extra 100 for those fortunate enough to own Elegy for the End. 4pc Instructor for an extra 120 is also optional.</li>

                        <li>This increase in team healing can also allow Kokomi to more easily trade HP and Healing Bonus investment for more EM stats. Furthermore, since Yaoyao can spend time effectively on-field, Kokomi rarely needs to spend much time in her Burst mode to take advantage of OHC. Overall, Yaoyao allows Kokomi to focus on building for her reaction damage.</li>

                  <div class="cons">Cons</div>
                  <div class="cons-item">Requires Nilou to play to its true potential.</div>
                  <div class="cons-item">No Anemo grouping means traditional methods of crowd control and grouping must be employed.</div>

                </div>
                <p>Due to Nilou’s unique Talent <b>Court of Dancing Petals</b>, which enhances standard Dendro Cores into Bountiful Cores, she is effectively purely designed around Bloom teams. She is also limited to just Hydro and Dendro teammates in order to activate this and other talents within her kit. As a tradeoff, she warps the entire reaction and its potential around her. She could be considered both the main support and main damage dealer of these compositions.</p>
                <p>Activated after Nilou completes her Skill setup, the team's Bountiful Cores explode significantly faster with increased damage and AoE. Since these Cores are created with Hydro and Dendro reacting together, her teams are primarily designed to facilitate as much Elemental application for these reactions as possible. Nilou’s kit and signature weapon also provide lots of EM with her teams, elevating the floor of the damage no matter which teammate is creating the Bountiful Core. The damage is so significant that her teams focus almost entirely around maximising Bountiful Core damage, with her teammates’ separate personal output being secondary. As a drawback, just like normal Dendro Core explosions, nearby characters suffer recoil damage. Since the damage and frequency is higher than normal, so too is the recoil. Therefore, a key focus of the team is survival.</p>
                <p>Kokomi is exceptionally synergistic here. Arguably almost everything about her kit is ideal for Nilou’s needs. See Nilou’s section in <a href="#teammates">Teammates 101</a> to learn more.</p>
                
                <p><b>Key points:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Bloom reaction damage scales heavily with Levels, so consider raising all members of a team to Level 90 as compulsory.</li>
                  <li>Bloom teams are <b>specialised in AoE</b>. Only a maximum of five Dendro Cores can exist at a certain time; if a sixth core is created, then the oldest existing Dendro Core will explode to trigger Bloom. The foundation of these teams is straightforward, <b>constantly applying Dendro and Hydro</b> to enemies, and combining this mechanic with Bountiful Cores innately exploding faster will compound the team’s explosive output greatly. The more EM the triggering character has, the more DMG will be dealt.</li>
                  <li>Bloom output also comes down to how much Dendro and Hydro teams can apply. Yet in practice, calculations of rotational DPS are futile, and expectations are going to be different from reality. Depending on the amount of enemies, where exactly they are positioned relative to the player and each other, the exact second and order you press each skill. All of these can affect the outcome. The exact character who creates a Bountiful Core as well as the exact ratios of who creates how many, <b>cannot be perfectly known or controlled</b>. Smart rotations and building EM on all characters is the best counter to this unpredictability.</li>
                  <li>A basic trick for smart rotations is understanding how Hydro interacts with Dendro. Hydro is the weakside Element in their interactions, similar to Cryo being the weakside to Pyro in Melt reactions. To put it simply, applying Hydro onto an enemy already affected by Dendro will <b>produce more Dendro Cores</b> than the reverse. See the <a href="https://keqingmains.com/misc/dendro/#Bloom" target="_blank">KQM Dendro Guide</a> for more information on this interaction. In practice, this can mean starting setups with a Dendro unit and then using Hydro teammates’ abilities after can be very efficient. However, despite being a good rule of thumb, Nilou still needs to complete an Elemental Skill dance to allow Bountiful Cores to be made, so there can be situations where she should be the first to set up.</li>
                  <li>Despite everything said thus far, because these teams are specialised in AoE, the exact Elemental application potential of each ability does not matter that much. Multiple enemies, as well as the AoE range of these Cores, can raise the performance. For example, due to their poor ICD on Elemental application, Traveler and Collei theoretically have limited Dendro application on their Bursts. However, each new enemy suffers their own fate, and is affected independently by Elemental application. In a nutshell, whilst these units may only apply Dendro X amount of times from their Bursts, that number is per enemy. Dendro can be applied to another enemy, and a Hydro teammate creating a Bountiful Core explosion will damage both enemies with its huge AoE.</li>

                    <div class="text">
                      <p><b>Team Description:</b></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Traveler and Collei are readily available as F2P characters, and arguably neither are in high demand as teammates. This is a huge advantage to Kokomi and Nilou, who are quickly able to field a powerful, Abyss-ready team that is low investment and doesn’t poach teammates.</li>
                        <li>Dendro Resonance will increase the party’s EM by 80.</li>
                        <li>Traveler has wide AoE on their Lea Lotus Lamp created from Elemental Burst cast, which is further increased by absorbing Hydro. This will increase its range by 3x and its hit AoE by 2x. This lays a good base for surrounding enemies being set up for Kokomi and Nilou to create many Bountiful Cores. Unfortunately, unlike Collei, the Lea Lotus Lamp doesn’t actually hit every enemy with every hit, so things can get more random. Meanwhile, Collei has good application on her Skill (especially with Sacrificial Bow giving two uses), and together with her Burst (although only having a small AoE), will spike the team’s Bountiful Core production rate and overall damage during their duration. Positioning her Burst carefully and doing an EQE combo can be powerful, but be very cautious about the recoil damage she can sustain during this on-field period, particularly with her fragile max HP.</li>
                        <li>Due to Traveler’s long lasting 15s Burst (at C2) and fast ability animations, they are the primary candidate to wield the <b>mandatory Deepwood Memories</b> set. Bloom explosions are considered Dendro damage, and given Dendro RES Shred is highly limited in sources (aside from Nilou’s C2), this set’s Shred of 30% is effectively a 22% unique damage multiplier vs common enemies.</li>
                        <li>Traveler provides 60 EM to on field characters with their A1 Talent, with Collei providing 60 to teammates at C4, as well as an extra 100 for those fortunate enough to own Elegy for the End. 4pc Instructor is also optional. Together, these support Nilou’s EM buffs to further raise the team's damage floor, limiting the issues with Bloom ownership.</li>

                    <div class="text">
                      <p><b>Team Description:</b></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>A standout Bloom team, Nahida drastically improves the composition’s QoL and versatility, thanks to her Elemental Skill, Tri-Karma Purification. Not only does this provide consistent Dendro application to all marked, but the linked damage across all enemies especially benefits these compositions which can otherwise lack control without Anemo grouping.</li>
                        <li>Nahida's natural scaling also synergises extremely well with Bloom. Her Skill has direct EM scaling and A4 Talent boosts its DMG and CRIT Rate, further incentivising building EM. All in all, this allows her to both contribute strong reaction and non-reaction damage without compromise. Very noticeable as previous Bloom incarnations, although powerful, have drastic reliance on pure reaction damage making up the majority of total damage.</li>
                        <li>Nahida's Elemental Burst provides a strong, long-lasting EM buff to on-field characters. Look to cast it during windows with invulnerable enemies or downtime. However, please note the many off-field reactions will not benefit from this.</li>
                        <li>For casual players, rotations and set ups are not at all important to worry about. It's possible to switch to characters and use abilities at random and see high success due to the flexibility and strength of this team. The team's damage has a <b>very high floor</b> and due to the way the Bloom reactions work, it's simple to bruteforce content.</li>
                        <li>For high skill players, this team has plenty of skill expression and smart play can push its limits very far. The key thing to pay attention to is making mental notes for the Skills and Bursts within the team, knowing at any given time which sources of Hydro application and Dendro application are available. With 2 Catalyst users in the team, on-demand sources are available by swapping either to Nahida or Kokomi as more of each Element is needed. Being in-sync with Elemental application allows the team to be truly consistent with Bloom production and maximum output.</li>
                        <li>As mentioned, Nahida improves the composition's versatility and makes it more well-rounded in tackling content. To further exemplify this, Kokomi can effectively use OHC instead of Gilded Dreams to strengthen her non-reaction damage and the team's overall single-target performance. Similarly, Collei can be built for more ATK and Crit than usual.</li>
                        <li>Collei’s strength is her flexibility. Traveler can be used instead of her, being more comfortable and casual due to faster animations, meaning they're less likely to sustain damage. However in more hardcore gameplay, Collei's frontloaded, on-demand Dendro application is very noticeable. Furthermore, her portable Dendro application via Boomerang and Sprout, as well as her shorter Burst cooldown can be very substantial in practical play, especially in multi-wave fights with enemies spawning in different positions of the map.</li>

                      <b>Rotation Example</b>
                      <p>Nahida Hold E > Nilou Setup > Kokomi E
                        Yelan Q + N1 + E > Nahida Normal Attacks
                      </p>
                      <p>(Rotations are flexible; make sure to recast Nahida’s Skill to mark new enemies!)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                      <p><b>Team Description:</b></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Triple Hydro is the alternative playstyle, focusing instead on Nahida attacking on-field. She needs to be regularly on field since Tri-Karma Purification will not self-sustain its damage and Dendro application without another source of reactions.</li>
                        <li>After the team sets up, <b>spamming Nahida's Basic Attacks</b> in combination with her Skill can supply more than enough Dendro application for constant Dendro Core production and Bloom explosions. Since she is the sole Dendro character reacting with 3 Hydro teammates, this can allow her to be the trigger for many of these Bloom reactions. This efficiently takes advantage of her high EM builds.</li>
                        <li>Important Note: Nahida has strong Dendro application, thus despite popular belief, she is <b>not the sole trigger of reactions</b> in this team. This means many Blooms will still be scaling from her teammates' EM stats.</li>
                        <li>Since Nahida spends frequent time on-field, this means unlike the more quickswap Double Dendro compositions, the bulk of damage sustained (from both recoil damage and enemies) will be received by 1 character. Unlike many of her teammates, Nahida will not have high HP. This means it's very helpful for Kokomi to have a more traditional healer build to <b>help with Nahida's survival</b>. An obvious consequence is that this investment will cost EM stats for Kokomi’s reaction damage.</li>
                        <li>As Nahida's Tri-Karma Purification is fueled by these additional Dendro attacks, Dendro Core production may pause when swapping off Nahida to cast or recast teammates' abilities. This can be somewhat mitigated by recasting Nahida's Skill just before switching off, but frequent time away from Nahida's on-field can feel really detrimental. Therefore, this playstyle can need even more attention and mentally keeping track of teammates' Skill and Burst cooldowns.</li>
                        <li>In addition to their strong Elemental Burst damage output, Xingqiu and Yelan both bring both similar and different advantages. Xingqiu's Rain Swords granting increased Interruption Resistance can make Nahida's on-field time much more comfortable. Moreover, his longer Skill and Burst cooldowns mean spending less time not attacking with Nahida. Alternatively, while Yelan's Burst has similar functionality to Xingqiu's Burst, her Skill has a shorter cooldown and can provide small grouping utility, which is very substantial considering Nilou teams are unable to use Anemo characters. It is also incredibly helpful for fast traversal in the overworld. This can make her specific team an overworld team of choice. Lastly, her A4 Talent provides a powerful DMG buff to Nahida. Together with Yelan's own personal damage, the team has a good amount of non-Bloom reaction damage, which is helpful in single-target encounters.</li>

                    <div>FAQ</div>
                  </h2>
                  <div id="bloom-faq-child" class="pressable-child" style="display: none;">
                    <p><b>(In Double Dendro) Which Hydro teammate do you primarily use on field?</b></p>
                    <p>Either Nilou or Kokomi can be used on-field effectively, depending on the situation (see the linked speedrun showcases). This also doesn’t necessarily require changing builds.
                      Kokomi on-field: Healing for the entire team, potentially more overall Cores produced due to more total Hydro application from Nilou’s off-field Tranquility Aura + Kokomi’s Basic Attacks. More potential reactions from Kokomi is also advantageous due to her higher EM builds.
                      Nilou on-field w/ Sword Dance combos: Fast setups, larger HP pool, further AoE with Luminous Illusion (Nilou’s 3rd hit from combos). This can be effective in shorter encounters.
                      </p>
                    <p><b> Are Nilou’s HP stats more important than everything, even sacrificing ER?</b></p>
                    <p>This actually is a tricky one. Firstly it is true that Nilou’s Max HP level can be considered as the gatekeeper of the team’s DMG ceiling. With every increase her HP increases Bountiful Core’s DMG bonus. So, the 2pc ToTM set bonus for 20% HP is a must, and prioritising as much HP as possible for artifact substats is too. If Nilou is wielding her signature weapon, the total will end up somewhere just over 70k HP.</p>
                    <p>Yet, the question is, should HP substats be prioritised at all costs, or is it worth losing a bit of HP from a Flower/Feather in return for high Energy Recharge stats?
                      Theoretically, building for example 140-150% ER may be considered inefficient.
                      However, consider that in practice Nilou’s Burst can have very important utility, something especially noticeable in speedruns. The goal is not necessarily to sacrifice HP% and constantly Burst in combat, but rather adding enough stats to make her Burst a regular tool at one’s disposal.
                      Naive experience may say her Burst is a DPS loss, but actually, it applies Hydro in a wide AoE.
                      This can quickly guarantee full enemy coverage with Bountiful Core explosions, especially to help finish off enemies who might be slightly out of range otherwise.
                      Furthermore, not all players are concerned with utmost speed. So another benefit is additional invincibility frames. Quite simply, trading some HP loss for a period of invulnerability is useful for many players.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Gilded Dreams or Instructor on Collei?</b></p>
                    <p>Yes, Instructor is a lot of EM for the team. Generally however, builds with proper 5* Artifacts can be more effective in practice. Firstly, this can be due to the tediousness of needing to guarantee a reaction with Collei each time she enters the field.
                      Secondly, one should also consider how Collei’s HP will be very low with 4* pieces.

                </div>
                <p>Mono Hydro isn’t a gimmick, but rather an example of strong synergy between the characters. Specifically, Mono Hydro teams are born from the concept of developing teams that can maximise the output from the Yelan+Xingqiu Double Hydro core. This is a well known powerhouse duo that is not tied to “Circle Impact” (positionally locked down in an area due to buffs or abilities), and is not restricted to any particular team archetype. Yelan is also a powerful damage dealer in general and only gets stronger with more investment. Naturally, players began searching for balanced and well rounded teams to pair them up with.</p>
                <p>A character like Kazuha is the immediate pick in this situation, as Genshin Impact’s premier Elemental DMG booster who offers significant grouping utility for practicality. Where does Kokomi fit in? Between these 3 characters, none of them fulfill the defensive role. So in order to have a practical and rounded composition, the final slot must be a healer or strong shielder. It would be disappointing having to replace Kazuha with another Anemo support with less team buffs and less consistent grouping utility. This team has been solved with genuine solutions like Hu Tao or Zhongli. Yet Kokomi, despite bringing weaker overall output, also solves the team and synergises with the Xingqiu-Yelan core exceptionally well.</p>
                <p>Kokomi lowers the Double Hydro core’s ER requirements, allowing them to comfortably use even their strongest 5* weapons without compromise. She takes the defensive utility role, being a great healer, and together with Kazuha they take little field time away from Normal Attack driving, thus maximizing the amount of Xingqiu and Yelan’s Burst procs as this team can be constantly Normal Attacking. Similar to Hu Tao, Zhongli, and her teammates, Kokomi does not miss losing out on Bennett’s prominent ATK buffs. She is very efficient in capitalising on all the buffs and debuffs her teammates are getting. Kokomi is providing all of this, whilst being very straightforward to pilot and keeping the team essentially immortal.</p>
                <p>This end result of these teambuilding considerations just happens to have Hydro characters.</p>

                      <b>Rotation Example</b>

                      <p>(As discussed, Kazuha’s Burst is entirely optional but can be used if adapting to the situation. See team description to learn more)</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="text">
                      <p><b>Team Description:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Very simple to play. The example rotation can be ignored and as long as Kazuha is periodically debuffing with his Skill, and Normal Attacks are spammed whilst characters are being cycled through, the damage output will be consistent and sufficient.</li>
                      <li>The distribution of damage in this team is well spread between the Hydro characters. At lower investment points, it can be around ~30% per, especially as Yelan may not have as powerful 3*/4* weapon options as Xingqiu might. However with this team's low ER requirements, Aqua Simulacra increases her damage significantly, making her deal above 40% of the team's damage. Meanwhile, Kokomi is not to be underestimated. She too can edge closer to 40% of the distribution, with something like her C1 being an increase of over 20% of her personal damage.</li>
                      <li>With increasing investment, Kazuha doesn’t need to be built to Burst consistently, and can instead redirect his own investment completely into EM to maximise the team’s Hydro DMG% buffs. This is due to his long animations taking time away from Normal Attacking to trigger teammates' Bursts. His own personal damage, as well as slightly extending his A4 buff, will not really make up for the lost hits.</li>
                      <li>For example, Yelan’s Exquisite Throw w/ Aqua Simulacra can total to 38.9k per wave, with Xingqiu’s Sword Rain w/ Primordial Jade Cutter potentially dealing 23-39k per wave if 3 or 5 swords are produced. Kazuha’s Burst (with him giving a weaker team buff) may deal roughly 59k including the additional Swirls.</li>
                      <li>Even as far as A4 buff downtime, an enemy may be defeated early and you will be switching back to Kazuha to reapply debuffs/grouping anyway. Moreover, with Yelan’s swift movement and the team not being bound to “Circle Impact”, such strict rotations can feel like a waste of time, and constantly Normal Attacking from enemy to enemy can feel very fluid. Without ER substats, for example he can go from buffing 32% Hydro DMG with his Skill to over 40%.</li>
                      <li>Understand these points, then take them with a grain of salt. The weaker the team’s gear, the more relevant Kazuha’s output becomes, so there can be breakpoints where this is no longer true. His Burst will also increase Kokomi’s damage, as there is no longer downtime of his buffs during her full Burst mode. There are also scenarios such as AoE fights where it is for sure valuable. Still, it is not necessary to build the ER stats for this, especially due to the loss of freedom and flexibility. Use the Burst as a situational tool and let it recharge over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>When is Kazuha's Burst recommended?</b></p>
                    <p>1. AoE situations<br>2. Fights with downtime and limited DPS windows (Time to setup and maximise the damage per rotation)<br>3. Teammates are not well invested</p>

                <p>Anemo grouping/buffs certainly add lots of value, and with smart synergy either Double Electro or Hydro can round things out.</p>

                        <li>A very <b>attainable</b> Kokomi-led team. The synergistic teammates are all 4-star, and utility weapons buffing the team are all F2P.</li>
                        <li>Compared to more Sucrose focused Electro-Charged teams, Kokomi not only performs stellar as a driver herself but has increased defensive utility. Additionally, Sucrose is available to share on-field driving plus provide ample team buffs/debuffs.</li>
                        <li>Beidou will provide much-valued <b>AoE DMG</b>, damage reduction, a shield at C1, and increased Electro application.</li>
                        <li>Gear options for the Catalyst users are very flexible. TTDS and Hakushin Ring will provide the most team buffs, which either Catalyst user can use. However, Prototype Amber enhances Kokomi’s damage whilst smoothing her Energy needs as Solo Hydro.</li>
                        <li>Sacrificial Fragments can also be used on Sucrose for additional grouping and Energy. This grouping flexibility can be very important for controlling Fischl and Kokomi’s AoE range.</li>

                        <li>Kazuha can function as a perfectly sufficient alternative to Sucrose. In fact, in this position his ability to buff Elemental DMG% as opposed to EM can be more efficient when Hydro characters are “Driving”; <b>non-reaction damage becomes more valuable</b>.</li>
                        <li>Kazuha also has shorter cooldowns on his Skill grouping, and this grouping is also <b>more fluid and controlled</b>.</li>
                        <li>If available, weapons like Favonius Sword or Xiphos’ Moonlight can greatly drive down Kokomi and Beidou’s Energy Recharge requirements, further improving their damage.</li>

                        <li>Yae Miko is better specialised for single-target performance than Beidou. Her Burst also brings a flexible frontloaded nuke to the team which can pay increasing dividends the more and more invested she is.</li>
                        <li>Kokomi can easily pass on the TTDS ATK buff to Miko before her Burst or buff with Hakushin Ring.</li>
                        <li>Yae Miko also does not snapshot her abilities, which can actually be an advantage in terms of facilitating Kazuha and Hakushin Ring’s buffs. Her damage will increase whilst off the field while also making setups much easier.</li>
                        <li>Very easy to play due to 3 deployables + Kazuha pulling enemies towards them</li>
                        <li>It is important to note the QoL from deployables. These teammates can provide their off-field Elemental application and damage without needing to trigger via Normal Attacks. This reduced reliance is great QoL, especially since Yae Miko requires high field time to use her Talents.</li>
                        <li>Fischl’s Energy generation and Electro Resonance is very significant to Yae Miko.</li>

                      <p><b>Note</b>: Since this is a mobbing focused core, providing rotations is not that useful. Use abilities as needed through adapting to incoming enemies. Some degree of “Unga Bunga” is necessary.</p>

                      <p><b>Team Description:</b></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>In content with several enemies and especially multi-wave fights (with enemies spawning close to the previous wave), Venti is extremely effective with this core.</li>
                        <li>His Burst should consistently absorb Hydro provided Kokomi’s Skill has been placed, and he will continuously trigger Electro Swirls and Electro-Charged. This makes his EM build very optimal.</li>
                        <li>His A4 Talent activating after his Burst expires will also assist Kokomi with recharging her own Burst, which will make her a lot easier to build than the previous team especially in these mobbing fights.</li>
                        <li>The final teammate can be previously mentioned Yae Miko or Kazuha, with the former’s Burst being lethal in conjunction with Venti’s in multiwave content, and the latter being able to double up on Venti’s role for even more reactions.</li>
                        <li>Take caution: Kokomi’s Bake-Kurage is placed next to her, and Venti’s Burst is aimed a few meters in front of him. This can require careful repositioning. Furthermore, Kazuha’s Skill and Plunge can often miss enemies wrapped in Venti’s Burst, so if playing them together you may need to stagger his usage.</li>

                <p>Hyperbloom compositions are an exciting blend of Mono Hydro and Electro-Charged teams in terms of functionality. Instead of Yelan and Xingqiu elevating the 1 on 1 performance, off-field Dendro support is played.</p>
                <p>As with Bloom, Kokomi’s Hydro application reacts with Dendro to produce Cores. When these Cores are hit with AoE Electro (ideally from EM-built teammates) it transforms into a Sprawling Shot that homes in on a close enemy. As hinted at, these reactions scale heavily with EM, so most Anemo supports already built for EM are ideal candidates for this task , either through Electro Absorption or Swirls. Importantly, a useful byproduct of this is that Kokomi’s Bake-Kurage spreading its Hydro application every 2s can be slow enough to allow Quicken activations, which can increase the team’s Electro DMG output.</p>

                <p><b>Two Strategies:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Triggering Sprawling Shots with off-field Anemo teammates (but may share reactions with AoE hits from Electro teammates)</li>
                  <li>Triggering Sprawling Shots solely with off-field Electro teammates</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As with many Transformative Reaction-heavy compositions, the damage floor can be high, and builds can be relatively straightforward to complete. This strategy is very effective for newer players pushing for 36*. However, the downsides can be off-putting, particularly for endgame players. The limited damage ceiling is evident, and despite being single-target focused compositions, with rainbow teams Energy management can be a pain. This is ironically compounded by Boss Fights, the primary single-target content, generating less free Energy than other fights.</p>

                        <li>Hyperbloom teams thrive with constant Elemental application from all 3 involved Elements. The issue is that such optimisation is typically a pain to work with. This particular lineup is able to somewhat succeed in that.</li>
                        <li>Kokomi, Fischl and Collei’s Elemental Skills can all be refreshed roughly every 12s. Although Collei’s Elemental Skill won’t last that full duration, her A1 Passive talent spawning Sprout, especially with duration extension via C2, will cover solid uptime.</li>
                        <li>Sucrose’s role is to trigger regular Sprawling Shots with her Electro Swirls, and she has the advantage over Kazuha due to the latter’s eventual downtime on Electro application. She can steadily Swirl away through her separate Elemental application ICD on Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, Skill, and Burst.</li>
                        <li>Ideally saving Sucrose’s Burst until late can allow it to absorb Electro, and therefore trigger further Hyperblooms whilst Kokomi is on-field in her Burst mode. Mileage may vary with achieving this consistently.

                        <li>Although a premium Hyperbloom team with four 5* teammates, the payoff for these investments can be rewarding. Kuki Shinobu also works similarly to Raiden Shogun.</li>
                        <li>Raiden Shogun uses a full EM build, and casts just her Elemental Skill. The AoE Electro damage it deals will <b>consistently trigger Hyperbloom reactions</b>. The Skill will also passively provide DMG% bonus to Yelan’s Bursts.</li>
                        <li>All 3 teammates have long-lasting Elemental application and said attacks are <b>not positionally limited to a circle</b>. This can allow for a lot of freedom and overall a relaxing experience. The only Skill that is subject to positioning is Bake-Kurage.</li>
                        <li>After setting up with the team, Kokomi is free to attack in her Burst mode. However make sure to reapply abilities; crucially, Nahida's Skill mark must be consistently reapplied to spawning enemies. Alternatively, Kokomi can play a more supportive off-field role and the playstyle can instead be more quickswap oriented, even spending more time on-field with Nahida.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Ayaka’s Elemental Burst and its DPS window are the significant portion of her team’s damage and playstyle. Its accuracy, as well as Ayaka’s overall kit, has high synergy vs Frozen targets, and therefore she commonly seeks a Hydro teammate.</li>
                  <li>Kokomi provides long lasting AoE off-field Hydro application. It doesn’t always hit, but is as close to an <b>ideal Hydro applicator</b> as Ayaka can get.</li>
                  <li>Additionally, Kokomi allows faster setups than other options due to only needing brief field time to cast her Elemental Skill.</li>
                  <li>Bake-Kurage lines up perfectly with Ayaka’s rotations and its AoE radius matches just right, overall creating a very <b>comfortable option</b>.</li>
                  <li>Buffs Ayaka via TTDS and Tenacity of the Millelith. Building for this is incredibly accessible and has a <b>low investment</b> cost.</li>
                  <li>Overall, her power budget focused this way and little care for personal damage allows the final teammates to be focused completely on utility or further enhancing Ayaka’s damage. In comparison, options like Xingqiu or Ayato could want buffs or debuffs themselves which can end up compromising on the uptime or consistency of Ayaka’s own buffs and debuffs. </li>
                  <li>Just like Kokomi, many common teammate’s talent casts are also centered around the character model. Teams can have great control and fluidity over the Freeze AoE zone, with a character like Kazuha pulling enemies towards Bake-Kurage to maintain consistency.</li>
                  <li>It is generally considered a DPS loss to spend field time refreshing her Hydro application via casting her Elemental Burst. It is also very hard to achieve such ER stats to sustain this. However, it is definitely comfortable for more casual players who will enjoy potentially 100% Freeze uptime and the ease of fights.</li>

                <p><b>FAQ: Should I use Kokomi’s Burst?</b></p>
                <p>Use her Burst if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It’s available, you’re fighting a stationary enemy, and you would appreciate the longer Freeze uptime in this situation. It’s a perfectly valid reason to make fights easier.</li>
                  <li>You need emergency healing.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Don’t use her Burst if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You think it’s tedious to mentally keep track of the jellyfish’s duration timers. As her Elemental Skill doesn’t have a clear indicator for when it will disappear, it’s possible to be late in casting to refresh, and you’ll end up wasting her Burst.</li>
                  <li>You want to stick to smooth, seamless rotations. For people who care about efficiency, Kokomi’s Burst takes enough time to where it might interfere with refreshing buffs off cooldown, Anemo Absorption, generating Energy and mixing in Ayaka’s auto attacks. For various reasons, it’s often a DPS loss.</li>
                  <li>Enemies are no longer next to the jellyfish. Her Burst only refreshes its duration in the current position.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Side note: You may not even have the artifacts to consistently Burst. ToTM is a commonly recommended set for Kokomi in these teams, and it’s a rather niche set in general. For most players, it’s recommended to just get her a set with the ideal mainstats, and then stop spending the Resin. Getting pieces that have enough Energy Recharge, especially when her Burst will only have niche use is hard to justify. However, it is up to the player to judge accordingly and to spend their Resin where they see value; this is only a recommendation.</p>
                
                <img src="images/teams/freeze2.png">
                <ul>
                  <li>Ganyu is also a Cryo damage dealer, and has fairly similar needs and benefits to freeze like Ayaka. Still, their playstyles are pretty different.</li>
                  <li>Ganyu’s Elemental Burst is powerful and long-lasting (AoE Icicles lasting 15s), and yet it can still snapshot buffs. Kokomi with TTDS and ToTM will give her significant ATK buffs. Ganyu’s Charged Attacks also benefit more from ATK buffs due to their increased CRIT Rate.</li>
                  <li>Kokomi’s brief field time and fast setups also allows for easier rotations and more Charged Attacks fired.</li>
                  <li>One thing to be careful of, though, is unlike Ayaka, Ganyu does naturally synergise better with teammates who cast talents slightly ahead of the player model. Think Venti’s Burst, Rosaria’s Skill, Mona’s Skill and Burst. This can lead to awkward AoE Freeze zones when mixing different styles of teammates together. This can be averted by using Kokomi’s Skill immediately before Ganyu’s Skill.</li>

          <h1>FAQ</h1>
          <div class="text">
            <p><b>How do her Elemental Burst, A4 Talent and 4pc OHC “Flatten/Normalise” her damage output?</b></p>
            <p>These talents add significant Bonus Flat DMG to Kokomi’s attacks, and 4pc OHC adds further damage based on healing. These scale from HP and Healing Bonus.</p>
            <p>Conversely, Normal Attack and Elemental Skill talents scale from ATK, and contribute to a minority of her damage output even when well invested.</p>
            <p>Kokomi’s Burst scaling gives the same damage increase to all Normal Attacks, and “flattens” the initial difference between specific hits in a combo. Song of Pearls similarly gives the same boost regardless of hit. Lastly, 4pc OHC makes up a notable amount of her damage, and synergises with the aforementioned damage sources by also scaling from the same attributes.</p>
            <p>Therefore, her Elemental Burst and A4 Talent in particular can be considered to reduce the differences in damage with individual attacks, and consequently makes investments in Normal Attack talents and ATK less valuable.</p>
          
            <p><b>Is it a problem that Kokomi cannot CRIT?</b></p>
            <p>See Passive: Flawless Strategy in <a href="#talents-breakdown">Talent Breakdown</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Should I use Kokomi’s Burst in Freeze teams?</b></p>
            <p>See Freeze section in <a href="#teams-breakdown">Teams</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Which artifact set in Bloom teams?</b></p>
            <p>There are several options. It is difficult to state a true Best-In-Slot and it mostly depends on the exact team, your playstyle, and the content faced. In Double Dendro teams where Kokomi will be an important reaction damage dealer, Gilded Dreams and Flower of Paradise Lost can be <b>very efficient in maximising her Bloom damage</b>. The downside of these sets is her healing will be lower than normal, which can make survivability difficult. These sets also suit high EM stat investment, meaning without HP and Healing Bonus artifacts her non-reaction damage will be dramatically low.</p>
            <p>On the flipside, Ocean Hued Clam is a viable set in all Bloom teams, with the build’s goal being balanced, Hybrid investment into all useful stats (HP/EM/ER/HB). It’s important to note that Bloom teams can have lots of EM buffs via Nilou, Key of Khaj-Nisut, Dendro Resonance, Instructor etc. Since EM is a stat that will have diminishing returns, there can be reduced value investing completely into EM and ignoring other stats. OHC’s damage to a lesser extent Healing Bonus, are <b>unique sources of damage</b> in comparison to EM which is much easier to get from Abyss Buff Cards. Overall, the reduced EM investment affecting her reaction damage can be made up for by increased non-reaction damage and Sea-Dyed Foam explosion damage. This can also improve the team’s <b>versatility</b> and Single Target damage potential.</p>

              <p>Due to Nilou’s unique Talent <b>Court of Dancing Petals</b>, which enhances standard Dendro Cores into Bountiful Cores, she is effectively purely designed around Bloom teams. She is also limited to just Hydro and Dendro teammates in order to activate this and other talents within her kit. Together, the goal is to generate as much AoE Dendro and Hydro application as possible, maximising Bloom detonations. Kokomi is very effective in achieving this alongside providing additional tools with her role compression.</p>
