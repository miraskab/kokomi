            <p>Truthfully, she can also be considered a victim of many misunderstandings and misinformation. Due to her unique scaling and diverse capabilities, surface level analysis and opinions have plagued her characterisation since her release, and her strengths have only appreciated in worth and understanding as time has gone by.</p>
            <p><b>Sangonomiya Kokomi</b> - The Divine Priestess and Supreme Leader of Watatsumi Island. Just like how she is versatile in handling military strategies and domestic affairs on her island, she is equally as busy in regards to her in-game capabilities: A healer, AoE Hydro applier, buffer, and on-field or off-field damage dealer. Enabling both vast role diversity and role compression, this affords her a spot in many teams.</p>
            <p>This guide aims to explain Kokomi's complexities and allow players to better utilize the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.</p>

            <div class="pros-item">In particular, the paladin archetype (healing and dealing damage) is a rare and sought after playstyle for many players to get the job done with comfort.</div>
            <div class="pros-item">Consistent Hydro application in a wide AoE is another key and sought after role.</div>
            <div class="pros-item">Elemental Skill being cast right in front of the player model is quite synergistic with other character abilities and allows very controlled setup sequences.</div>
            <div class="pros-item">Has synergy with an incredible number of teammates. Accounts are almost guaranteed to have multiple teams available.</div>
            <div class="pros-item">Incredibly fast animations allow for fast setups and more efficiency.</div>
            <div class="pros-item">Many weapons at her disposal, including several F2P options.</div>
            <div class="pros-item">Artifact farming can be streamlined due to not needing CRIT; fewer stats to seek out.</div>
            <div id="cons">Cons</div>
            <div class="cons-item">Teams generally utilise a few of her roles. Investments in certain areas can be useful or useless depending on the team. This includes talents, weapons, artifacts and constellations.</div>
            <div class="cons-item">Despite artifact farming being streamlined, CRIT stats have no value, meaning a reduced amount of useful rolls. This can also limit her damage ceiling.</div>

                    <div>
                      <p><b>Plunging Attack</b></p>
                      <p>Gathering the might of Hydro, Kokomi plunges towards the ground from mid-air, damaging all opponents in her path. Deals <b>AoE <b class="text-colored-main">Hydro DMG</b></b> upon impact with the ground.</p>

                </div>
                <p>A 3-hit Normal Attack combo and AoE Charged Attack. Normal Attacks are <b>projectiles</b> with very small AoE. Her Charged Attack has a larger AoE and uses a separate Internal Cooldown for Hydro application. Therefore it can be useful for shield breaking or maintaining Hydro auras.</p>
                <p>However, the usefulness of these attacks is a separate discussion to the value of its Talent scaling.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that Kokomi's <b>basic attacks have two sets of scaling</b>. This talent scales off ATK and is largely an insignificant portion of her on-field damage output, which her Elemental Burst talent has more relevance towards. For example, at Talent Level 9 it can account for around 9% of her total damage in a Mono Hydro team. Past a bare minimum, investment in this talent is of the lowest priority.  </p>
                <p>With Constellation 1, the 3rd hit of her Normal Attack string will supply an additional attack with a fixed scaling based on her Max HP, although the extra hit is not considered a Normal Attack. Due to its fixed scaling nature, having this Constellation can further diminish the benefits of leveling this talent. (see <a>Talent Level Priority section</a> for more)</p>
                <p>As with all Catalyst users, ATK SPD buffs like the 10% buff via her Constellation 4 act as direct multipliers to Normal Attack spam, provided she does not get interrupted.</p>

                      <p>Summons a "Bake-Kurage" created from water that can heal her allies. Using this skill will apply the <b>Wet</b> status to Sangonomiya Kokomi.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <p><b>Bake-Kurage</b></p>
                      <p>Deals <b class="text-colored-main">Hydro DMG</b> to surrounding opponents and heal nearby active characters at fixed intervals. This healing is based on Kokomi's Max HP.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>A continuous 12s source of healing and AoE Hydro application, it is the constant pillar of her kit and used in every team to great effect. It has three significant value propositions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Area of Effect</li>
                  <li>Sustained</li>
                  <li>Off-field</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bake-Kurage has no ICD on its Elemental application and will therefore be applying Hydro onto enemies every 2 seconds. Only one Bake-Kurage can exist on the field at a time. Including the initial hit, it will attack for a total of 7 times over the course of 12s. Each following pulse has a 67% chance to generate one Hydro elemental particle (requires hitting enemies), meaning on average 4 Hydro particles are generated over its base duration (the final tick cannot generate a particle).</p>
                <p>Casting her Elemental Burst in conjunction with her A1 Talent Passive will refresh the Skill's duration. Despite it normally being locked into a stationary position for 20s (refreshing via Burst does not allow repositioning), using a weapon like Sacrificial Fragments can allow readjustments. This tech is most significantly used in Nilou Bloom teams, which lack grouping sources yet rely on Bake-Kurage heavily. </p>
                <p>On cast, it will also apply the Wet status onto Kokomi. This can cleanse Elemental debuffs, although it can also be a disadvantage by making her vulnerable to Freeze.</p>
                <p><b>Additional Tech Info:</b> This Skill also snapshots buffs on cast. Consequently, while it does not normally snapshot the HP scaling from her Burst, it is possible to snapshot it by recasting her Skill as Burst mode is ending, and quickly swapping off before the first tick of the new Skill. Using a simple application of this, it is possible to maintain 100% uptime on bonuses just by timing your rotations. Still, this Tech can be difficult and is generally not worth using in practice.</p>

                        <li>Sangonomiya Kokomi's Normal Attack, Charged Attack and Bake-Kurage DMG are increased based on her <b>Max HP.</b></li>
                        <li>When her Normal and Charged Attacks hit opponents, Kokomi will restore HP for all nearby party members, and the amount restored is based on her <b>Max HP</b>.</li>
                        <li>Increases Sangonomiya Kokomi's <b>resistance to interruption</b> and allows her to walk on the <b>water</b>'s surface.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>These effects will be cleared once Sangonomiya Kokomi leaves the field.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Requiring 70 Energy, casting this will activate Kokomi's Ceremonial Garment, adding considerable <b>HP scaling</b> to each of her abilities for a 10s duration. She will lose this state upon switching out. Although unused in popular off-field focused roles (such as Freeze), her Burst is a crucial component in all her other teams. Alongside the refreshed and buffed Bake-Kurage, players will typically spam Normal Attacks, which now heal the entire party with each successful hit. Therefore, during this period, in addition to dealing increased damage with increased resistance to interruption, <b>the party is effectively immortal.</b></p>
                <p>She will also have increased resistance to interruption during this period, although it is not Infinite Poise/Hyper Armor. Therefore, reinforcements such as Xingqius Rain Swords will result in noticeable improvements in tanking heavy hits.</p>
                <p>Moreover, her A4 Talent further increases the HP scaling of her Basic Attacks by 15% of her Healing Bonus while under the effects of her Elemental Burst. This actually makes her damage output scale the best with stacking HP and Healing Bonus, due to how significant the damage gained from these is. Therefore, these also make the aforementioned ATK scaling of her base Basic Attacks have low relevance (See the <a>FAQ</a> for further explanations). For example, at Talent Level 9 the Burst mode's enhanced Basic Attacks and Bake-Kurage can account for around 58% of her total damage in a Mono Hydro team (See <a>Talent Leveling Priority</a> for more info). This makes <b>resource investment in her Elemental Burst Talent the most valuable</b> by far for her on-field playstyles.</p>
                <p>All of her Constellations enhance her output whilst in her Burst state, although her Constellation 1 uses a separate, fixed scaling (30% of Max HP).</p>
                <p>She is also able to walk/run on any water’s surface during this state, which has niche applications in overworld traversal.</p>

                <p>Due to Bake-Kurage normally having an 8s downtime, this Passive allows her to maintain 100% uptime on her Elemental Skill. Higher uptime means increased particle generation, Hydro application, healing and buff uptime (if using Tenacity of the Millelith).</p>
                <p>In fact, some niche teams may just alternate between casting her Skill and Burst every 10s and immediately switch her out in order to maintain this constant Bake-Kurage. However, this is very rarely optimal, and in her most common Freeze teams, Kokomi actually hardly even uses her Burst or this Passive in favour of just using her Skill roughly every 20s.</p>
                <p><b>Important Note: Refreshing Bake-Kurage requires it to be on the field when the Burst animation ends, so please cast your Elemental Burst at least a second before the Skill expires</b>. This can be annoying as it necessitates either keeping mental timing or doing precise rotations, otherwise the window for refreshing may be missed, wasting her Burst too.</p>

                        <p>Sangonomiya Kokomi has a 25% <b>Healing Bonus</b>, but a 100% decrease in <b>CRIT Rate</b>.</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                <p>Certainly the most obfuscated part of her kit in terms of implications. Simply put, this combines with the rest of her kit to trade CRIT scaling for Healing Bonus scaling. That's all it really has to mean for all intents and purposes. However, nuanced implications can be assessed:</p>
                <p>The downside of this tradeoff is that CRIT stats are effectively useless. Less important for weapon choice, since that can be easily navigated, yet this still has a huge impact on her Artifacts. Typically, players yearn for many CRIT substat rolls on their pieces; however, on Kokomi, they are dead rolls. Combined with Healing Bonus only being available as a main stat via Circlet, and unavailable through substats, these elements <b>limit her growth via artifact investment</b>. It's also well known that typically CRIT substats provide the highest damage increases in most characters' situations, so this further accentuates the loss in growth potential.</p>
                <p>The upside is that ultimately this tradeoff has borderline <b>no significance to limiting her actual roles</b  >. Just because CRIT multipliers are lost does not mean she cannot be the highest damage dealer in significant teams. It’s more akin to a <b>twist or gimmick</b> to her builds more than anything. It’s smarter to consider it nothing more than a twist too.</p>
                <p>Another obvious upside is that this Passive also enables her to lean more heavily into the paladin archetype. Her damage dealing builds (or any of her builds) will never shut her off from the healing role, and (aside from Bloom teams valuing EM) target investment goals are streamlined into hunting basically just HP, ER, and Healing Bonus stats to boost her entire kit.</p>

              <p>In her Burst mode “<b>Ceremonial Garment</b>”, Kokomi is relatively easy to pilot and you can largely do almost anything as long as you keep using Normal Attacks. Complicating Combos rarely benefits a team's performance dramatically, and actually poor execution can be a net negative. Such consequences include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>running out of Stamina</li>
                <li>poor positioning</li>
                <li>losing procs from off-field damage dealers</li>
              </ul>

              <p>It is recommended to play on-field Kokomi in whatever manner feels comfortable for your account and your device while keeping in mind some basic reminders:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dashing and regular repositioning has very practical use in combat. It’s helpful to not rely too much on her range, especially since her Normal Attacks make her move slightly backwards. There is also the range of her Skill and other team abilities to consider. Moreover, while Kokomi can tank enemy attacks with her healing, these movements can also aid with dodging heavy attacks that would otherwise stagger her.</li>
                <li>Her Charged Attacks are very Stamina-intensive, and consecutive use can limit Stamina reserve for dashing.</li>
                <li>Still, as mentioned earlier, Charged Attacks are an effective tool in applying more Hydro for both shield breaking and team reactions. They also spawn directly below the target, providing vertical range against enemies on hilichurl towers and allowing her to hit annoying targets behind fences/obstacles.</li>
                <li>The HP and Healing Bonus scaling from Nereid's Ascension and Song of Pearls flatten the differences in the damage scaling on her Normal and Charged Attack hits. Furthermore, a lot of her output can come from the Ocean-Hued Clam set effect, which generally hits its DMG cap every 3.5s. The higher Talent multipliers of her 3rd Normal Attack hit and Charged Attack are therefore less important than they initially look.</li>
                <li>Her Constellation 1 highly incentivizes finishing her combo with the third Normal Attack. This results in more damage AND more Hydro application.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><b>Using N3 or N3D is most recommended.</b></p>
              <p>N3 - This is easy and just uses her full Normal Attack string, whilst saving any complications for practical adjustments like prior mentioned dash repositioning or dodging. This also allows her to remain in her Normal Attack animations longer, potentially allowing her to trigger more Sword Rain and Exquisite Throws from Xingqiu and Yelan. Full Burst mode target: 5N3</p>
              <p>N3D - The N3 animation can be dash canceled for minimal improvement right after the projectile forms, but take care to learn the timing as dashing before it forms results in no damage being dealt at all. For an example comparison, whilst full left-click spam could get 5N3, efficient dash canceling can net an extra N2 before her Burst mode state expires.
                Full Burst mode target: 5N3D N2 (6 N3D is theoretically possible)
              </p>
              <!-- <iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YvXp8d4za4?autoplay=1&mute=1&loop=1" ></iframe> -->
              <p><b>N2W (Not recommended), N2D (Partially recommended)</b></p>
              <p>How to perform N2W: Trigger two Normal Attacks, tap the walk button with careful timing, trigger two Normal Attacks again, repeat.
                Example Burst mode target: 9N2W
              </p>
              <p>N2 combos take advantage of her small damage differences between her hits, so getting more overall hits in can result in higher output. For example, squeezing 9N2W’s can result in a 9-10% DPS increase for Kokomi in Mono Hydro over N3 spamming, and in Electro-Charged teams it may trigger more Beidou Burst/Fischl C6 procs.</p>
              <p>However, that doesn’t make it recommended. N2W is impractical to consistently perform for most people, and even lacks repositioning without N2D. The resulting <b>poor execution can result in net losses</b>. Further losses can occur when playing alongside off-field damage dealers like Yelan. Losing out on their hits will be a dramatic loss (Yelan's Exquisite Throws trigger whilst in Normal Attack animations, and Kokomi's N3 naturally has more time in the animation).</p>
              <p>Even in the above-mentioned Mono Hydro example as a best case scenario, with the team giving her high personal damage output (⅓~ of the team's output depending on investments), she is still only one of several damage dealers, and other comps like Electro-Charged can have her dealing a lower damage share than that. 
                Therefore, the practical damage gain is always <b>questionable in terms of team DPS</b> for how much focus you need to execute them in otherwise relatively easy teams. Still, if stamina is available, <b>throwing in a few N2D's to speed up a fight is helpful</b> and can be recommended. Just don't attempt to spam it too much.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if Constellation 1 is acquired, utilising the extra fish attack for increased damage from full N3 combos is advised regardless.</p>

              <b>Nereid's Ascension > Bake-Kurage >> Normal Attack</b>
              <p>Crown Elemental Burst if interested</p>
              <p>As explained many times by now, Kokomi on field has several sources of damage, which skews perceptions of Talents. </p>
              <p>It should be understood that, due to its ATK scaling, her Normal Attack Talent (The Shape of Water) is very low priority and even in the end game can be reasonably left at Level 6.</p>
              <p>Kokomi's Burst, Nereid's Ascension is her most significant talent, and out of all options the most worthwhile to take to Talent Level 10 or close thereto.</p>
              <p>Her Skill, Kurage's Oath, has relevance for all playstyles. However, in popular off-field focused teams of hers such as Freeze, her healing is generally more than satisfactory at any reasonable investment level; therefore, it's never really necessary to prioritise it to the point of being leveled the highest.</p>
              <p>Still, be cautious of outside scaling damage sources and how significant they are. Kokomi never really makes the most from Talent level ups.</p>
              <p>For example, with Level 9 Talents and Prototype Amber, in the Mono Hydro team with Yelan, Kazuha (no Burst), and Xingqiu, Kokomi's damage distribution against 1 enemy can be calculated to be as follows:</p>

              </div>
              <p>Take the exact numbers with a grain of salt, but use it to note how her Elemental Burst and Ocean Hued Clam (OHC) procs can make up the majority of her damage (with OHC procs being independent of Talent Level if sufficient healing is guaranteed, as each proc will hit the damage cap).</p>

Although do note that she still deals a lot of damage via Ocean-Hued Clam, which is independent of this.</p>

            <p><b>Note</b>: It is highly recommended to treat the following section as a general guideline. Ultimately, we recommend using the <a>Genshin Optimizer</a> to finalize your builds. In particular, it allows you to choose team buffs and can more accurately judge the correct balance between offensive stats for artifacts specific to your account. In case you need one, here’s a great tutorial for how to use Genshin Optimizer: <a>Genshin Optimizer Tutorial Playlist</a>.</p>
            <p>Due to her diverse role, both Kokomi’s ideal artifact sets and target stats are never set in stone. Rather, it is something to assess after deciding on a team composition and required strategy for her in that role. Consider skipping to the Teams section and reevaluating choices after.</p>
            <p>Sets that are not mentioned are not relevant enough and not recommended for consideration.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text table" id="artifacts">
            <div class="table-name artifacts-name interactive" id="artifacts-name0"><img src="images/artifacts/ohc.webp"></div>
            <div class="table-name artifacts-name interactive" id="artifacts-name1"><img src="images/artifacts/totm.webp"></div>

            <div class="table-item artifacts-item" id="artifacts-item0">
              <div class="item-body">
                <p>OHC increases Kokomi’s Healing Bonus and provides a strong additional source of AoE Physical damage through her healing prowess. It does want Kokomi in her Burst mode to hit its damage cap, typically 24.3k damage 3 times during the state. Outside of the Burst state, hits often deal about ~30% of that depending on investment, but this is still highly appreciated.</p>
                <p>This is her general go-to set in most circumstances, and highly recommended to farm for on-field playstyles especially. Probably the most versatile set too, considering it can function adequately in off-field roles, providing her HP and Healing Bonus stats are built well. </p>
                <p><b>Note</b>: OHC is also great in Bloom teams.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item artifacts-item" id="artifacts-item0">
              <div class="item-body">
                <p>With her long lasting Elemental Skill, ToTM sees effective use in some of Kokomi’s off-field teams where, with its 4pc set bonus, she can give ATK buffs to significant damage dealing teammates. A perfect example would be when supporting Ayaka in a Freeze team. Kokomi’s output with OHC is replaced by increasing her buffing capabilities with 4pc ToTM. The 2pc set bonus will also give her 20% HP for reinforced healing.</p>
                <p>With her Burst refreshing her Skill to circumvent Bake-Kurage downtime, she can have practically permanent uptime on the ATK buffs. However, permanent uptime is not necessary due to many teams having either burst damage windows that fit within the buff uptime or teammates with snapshottable abilities.</p>
                <p>For players struggling to farm OHC for on-field roles, strong ToTM sets can also suffice as poverty alternatives.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item artifacts-item" id="artifacts-item0">
              <div class="item-body">
                <p>GD sees surging use as a Kokomi set due to her partnership with Nilou in Bloom teams, although OHC can still be preferred. These teams can be somewhat random in regards to exactly which character is triggering Bountiful Core explosions; however, one constant is Kokomi being a frequent trigger of these explosions. Therefore, EM is an extremely valuable stat for her, and Gilded Dreams supplies it in mass quantities. </p>
                <p><b>Note</b>: In Triple Hydro teams, Gilded Dreams gives less EM than 2pc 2pc EM sets (Gilded Dreams/Wanderer’s Troupe/Flowers of Paradise Lost)</p>
                <p>Nilou Bloom teams as a whole like lots of EM stats. Additionally, the domain to farm this also supplies Deepwood Memories, a must-have set in Bloom teams. Therefore, with this composition, farming GD is very efficient.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item artifacts-item" id="artifacts-item0">
              <div class="item-body">
                <p>For use in Bloom teams. FoPL can provide an even bigger increase to Kokomi’s Bloom reaction damage than GD.</p>
                <p>The reaction damage bonuses it provides is additive with Elemental Mastery, meaning the value of this set will be stronger the more EM Kokomi already has. This also works vice versa, and at minimal EM investment it may not even be an improvement over Gilded Dreams. When using this set, it is therefore recommended to stack as much EM as possible.</p>
                <p>However, a key drawback of FoPL is that even with well invested builds, the damage increases over GD can be minimal. With Bloom teams also requiring Deepwood Memories sets, farming for GD can be more efficient for overall results. Also remember, OHC is a valid artifact set even in Bloom teams too.</p>

              <p>With the sets covered, we can turn to the stats to hunt for. As highlighted below, these also vary depending on the team.</p>
              <p><b>On-Field Kokomi (General)</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>HP%/ER% Timepiece, Hydro DMG% Goblet, Healing Bonus% Circlet. Maximises damage whilst also strengthening healing performance.</li>
                <li>For substats, prioritise ER > HP% > HP >= ATK%. Being able to consistently Burst is crucial in these teams, so make sure Kokomi’s ER statline is sufficient for her team. Fortunately, most weapon options contribute towards her Energy needs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>On-Field/Off-Field Kokomi (Nilou Bloom)</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>In Double Dendro teams: EM Timepiece, EM or Hydro Goblet, EM or Healing Bonus Circlet all work. The incoming recoil damage from Bountiful Cores may tempt more HP stats for healing reinforcement, but remember Kokomi’s reaction damage is significant in these teams. Still, EM mainstats are not mandatory. Hydro DMG and Healing Bonus can be used for increased non-reaction damage and survivability.</li>
                <li>For substats, prioritise as much ER, HP% and EM as possible. Some of these main stat pieces are rare, so take what is on offer.</li>
                <li>In Triple Hydro teams: HP% Timepiece, HP% Goblet, Healing Bonus% Circlet. Focusing on survival is fine. Kokomi can still trigger some reactions, so look for EM substats.</li>
              </ul>
              <!-- <iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbdwoyZjRjs?" ></iframe> -->
              <p><b>Off-Field Kokomi (General)</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>HP% Timepiece, HP% Goblet, Healing Bonus% Circlet. Maximises healing for comfort since her damage is often of secondary importance.</li>
                <li>For substats, prioritise HP% and HP. ER substats can be beneficial by giving more regular windows to refresh her Elemental Skill via Burst as needed. Though 100% uptime is often unnecessary, having options available doesn’t hurt, especially when healing performance can be easily sufficient enough.</li>
              </ul>

                  <p><b>Note</b>: In Bloom teams, it is unreasonable to calculate damage differences between weapons due to their nature and <b>infinite variables</b>.
